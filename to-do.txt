# VertNet Project Ideas

- Read in the file and output some basic stats about records
    - number of records
    - number of species
    - number of records with coordinate data
    - number of museums with specimens
        - maybe number of records at each museum

- Include a function that outputs a map with the data
    - Output should include some info on the number of records that could not be plotted
    - Output countries in color
